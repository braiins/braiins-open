# Overview

This is Stratum protocol software package that provides:

- Stratum V1/V2 primitives implemented in Rust
- [Simulator](sim/README.md) used to verify the design of Stratum V2

## Stratum Server Certificate Workflow

Stratum V2 security is based on noise handshake, where the static public key of the stratum server is signed by a simple **Certification Authority**. Any stratum client is required to have a preconfigured the public key of this certification authority and use it to verify the authenticity of the static public key presented by the server.

### Building the Tool

For security reasons, we recommend using the tool from sources.

Setup the Rust toolchain installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

### Workflow
The overall workflow requires:

#### Generating a **Certification Authority ED25519 keypair**

 This **CA keypair** *MUST* never be deployed to a stratum server and is used
 exclusively for signing the server keys:

 ```
 cargo run -- gen-ca-key
 ```

The resulting keys are in:
  - `ca-ed25519-public.key`, and
  - `ca-ed25519-secret.key`.

Keep them safe!

#### Generating server keypair

```
cargo run -- gen-noise-key
```

The resulting keys are in:

 - `server-noise-static-secret.key`, and
 - `server-noise-static-public.key`.

#### Signing the server public key

 We will sign the public key from the previous step with the **CA Private Key
** and produce a certificate that has a specified validity (defaults to 90
 days).

```
cargo run -- sign-key --public-key-to-sign server-noise-static-public.key
 --signing-key ca-ed25519-secret.key
```

The following files are to be uploaded to the stratum server that provides
 stratum v2 (e.g. our ii-stratum-proxy):

 - `server-noise-static-secret.key`, and
 - `server-noise-static-public.cert`.

#### Testing Stratum Client Setup

In case, you decide to run the miner against your own stratum V2 endpoint (e
.g. [ii-stratum-proxy](../../stratum-proxy/README.md))
) you
 have to pass it the actual public key of the Pool CA that has been used for
  signing.


## Running Protocol Test suite

`cargo test --all`
