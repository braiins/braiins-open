# This is the central place to specify Tokio dependency.
# Currently we're using git master version because of [PR #1602](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/1602)
# Once a version containing that PR is released, it can be used here.
# Additionally, Rust toolchain version used in dependant crates should agree
# with the one used by Tokio. Currently, that is: `beta` (that is Rust 1.39 at the time of writing)
